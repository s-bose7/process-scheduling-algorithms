#### process scheduling unlocked!!

#### Process scheduling algorithms are primarily two types - preemptive and non-preeemptive, while non-preemtive algorithms are easier to implement, preemptive algorithms are more suited for real world use cases



## Things I'm assuming:
  #### 1. The length of the Process Control Block is constant in runtime of these algorithms.
  #### 2. We know the total burst time of CPU, after loading the processes in main memory.
  #### 3. There would not be any I/O wait time associated with the processes.



## Non-preemptive implementation
  #### STEP 1: Take input of number of processes, and respective burst time, arrival time, finally make a process control block, which holds all of the information about each process.
  #### STEP 2: Load all the processes into RAM.
  #### STEP 3: During the loading process, we will estimate a value of total burst time for all the processes in the RAM. Assuming there are a limited number of processes & each has burst time associated                  with it, although in real world scenarios we often are not able to estimate the total burst time, for those cases weâ€™d have to predict the value of total burst time.
  #### STEP 4: Declare a time variable, which will track the schedule time of each process. Initially time = 0;  
  #### STEP 5:  Iterate until time <= estimated_total_burst_time
  #### STEP 6: For each iteration we will update the READY_QUEUE, our algorithm will pick the process that has a Minimal burst time for SJF, Highest priority for Priority scheduling and Lowest arrival time                for FCFS.
  #### STEP 7; After picking a process, we will compute its wait time and turnaround time, and flag the process as terminated. 
  #### STEP 8: Finally we will estimate the avg wait time and avg turnaround time for all of the processes in the process control block.
